        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <p><h4>Difference Between var let and const </h4>
        Var :<br>
        The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript 
        is called<br> "declaring" a variable: var carName; After the declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value).
        <br><br>
        let:<br>
        Variables declared with the let keyword can have Block Scope.<br>
        Variables declared inside a block {} cannot be accessed from outside the block:1
        <br><br>
        const:<br>
        The const keyword creates a read-only reference to a value. const VARIABLE_NAME = value;<br>
         By convention, the constant identifiers are in uppercase.

        <h2>Question 3</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>1. Number:</h3>  JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
            Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.

            <h3>2. Strings:</h3>  JavaScript strings are used for storing and manipulating text.
            A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

            <h3>3. Arrays:</h3>   JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
            Array items are separated by commas.
            
            <h3>4. Empty values:</h3>  An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
            An empty string has both a legal value and a type.

            <h3>5. Null:</h3>  In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
            Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
            You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.
